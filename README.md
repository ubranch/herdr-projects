<h3 align="center">Run a whole project across your coding agents without handing each one its task or keeping track of who is doing what</h3>

<p align="center">Herdr Projects lets you run a larger piece of work in <a href="https://herdr.dev">Herdr</a> when one agent isn't enough and managing five by hand is a job in itself. You talk to one coordinator agent. It starts a separate agent for each task on its own branch, gives every one of them the same goal, instructions and memory, and Herdr's own sidebar shows you which threads need you, which are ready for review and which are still working.</p>

## Keep one conversation going while the work happens in parallel

The coordinator never does the work itself, so it's always free to answer you. Each task runs in its own thread: a separate agent in its own git worktree and branch, or in its own folder when there's no repository. You read reports and answer the threads that need you instead of briefing every agent yourself.

## Choose between briefing each agent by hand, one long agent session, a cloud projects product, or a coordinator in Herdr

| | **Herdr Projects** | Briefing agents by hand | One long agent session | Cloud projects products |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **No extra software fee** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Parallel tasks on separate branches** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Same instructions and memory for every task** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **One conversation that stays free to answer** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Threads grouped by what needs you** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Runs on your own machines** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Adopts an agent pane you already started** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Works with the agent CLI you already use** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Runs with no machine of yours switched on** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Keep your attention on decisions. Herdr Projects starts and tracks the threads, your agents do the work, and you choose what to review, answer, or merge.

## Tell the coordinator what you want. See which thread needs you in the sidebar.

### 📈 See every thread at a glance

Each thread's sidebar row shows its id and title, and a line under it with what Herdr's own state word does not say (`review · PR #4`, `~40%`) and the agent's own activity. Agents and spaces are grouped by project: the project's home space and its coordinator head the group with the project's name in bold, then its threads with what needs you first and its other spaces as Herdr's own rows; everything else comes last. The tab bar says `projects: 2 need you`. `prefix+a` opens one popup with threads, tasks, inbox, routines and settings, where every thread's own list of next steps is a number key away.

### ⚡ Stop briefing every agent yourself

Say what you want once. The coordinator proposes threads and waits for your go-ahead, then each thread starts from a brief with the project's goal, your standing instructions, the project's memory and its task, on the agent you pick (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode or any other kind Herdr runs). Lessons a thread reports under `## Remember` flow back into memory for the next one.

### 💬 Know when a thread needs an answer

Agents report their own progress, so a thread that asked you something shows `needs you` even when it looks idle, and you get a notification that names the project and the thread. A background ticker follows pull requests: failing checks and review comments go back to the thread to fix, and a merged pull request resolves the thread and removes its worktree and branch once its agent has finished (it may still be tagging or deploying).

Native Windows x64 currently needs PowerShell 7 and a Rust MSVC source build from this checkout. The [ubranch fork](https://github.com/ubranch/herdr-projects) has no published Windows release assets. Use the [Windows installation instructions](docs/getting-started.md#2-install-the-plugin), not the upstream install command.

## Updating

**Windows fork policy:** preserve the port on `ubranch/herdr-projects`'s stable `main`, and merge upstream `main` only after the exact candidate passes both Windows/Linux native gates: `cargo +stable fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo +stable clippy --locked --all-targets --target <native-target> -- -D warnings`, followed by locked tests/builds and real CLI smoke checks. The **Upstream sync** workflow is configured for a best-effort 15-minute schedule and manual dispatch. Open branches and PRs are **track only**: no merging, testing or installing unmerged code, including upstream Windows PR #100. Merged PRs become ordinary upstream `main` updates. Conflicts or failing gates stop promotion, never force/reset the port. See [fork maintenance and activation](docs/operations.md#windows-fork-maintenance); required gates are not a claim that a run has passed.

The Windows port and sync workflow are published on `ubranch/herdr-projects`'s `main`. From a clean fork `main` checkout whose `origin` is `ubranch/herdr-projects`, run `git pull --ff-only origin main` and deliberately rebuild with `scripts/install.ps1`. The Rust binary implements the plugin; PowerShell scripts only build, install and link it. Cloud sync does not install binaries or overwrite local development work; Windows release assets remain unpublished. Do not switch to upstream `main` to satisfy `update`. See [Updating](docs/getting-started.md#updating); stop/restart the ticker only when deliberately updating the installed plugin, not during source checks, and leave existing Herdr sessions running.

Before upgrading an existing Unix installation to this port, stop its ticker with the old binary: ticker metadata now lives in `.ticker.info`, not `.ticker.lock`.

**Once, on macOS/Linux if you're on 0.2.2 or older** (`herdr-projects --version`), which has no `update` yet:

```bash
herdr-projects ticker stop
herdr plugin install eliasstravik/herdr-projects
herdr-projects doctor --fix
herdr-projects ticker start
```

Herdr reinstalls the plugin in the same folder, and the plugin keeps your `~/.local/bin/herdr-projects` link pointing at it. If you linked a local checkout with `herdr plugin link` instead, run `git pull --ff-only origin main` from a clean `main` checkout and `sh scripts/install.sh` in place of the `herdr plugin install` line.

**From then on, for release-based macOS/Linux updates:**

```bash
herdr-projects update           # fetch, install the new binary, doctor --fix, restart the ticker
herdr-projects update --check   # only print the installed and the newest version
```

`update` works for both install types and changes nothing when you're already on the newest release. Its `doctor --fix` also links the `autoproject` skill for each harness you configured, so existing users don't need to run `configure` again. A linked checkout must be on `main` with no uncommitted changes, or `update` stops and says why. When the install fails, the old version stays installed and the ticker is restarted. `doctor` says when a newer version is out.

## Get your questions answered

### Do I need to know how to code?

You need to be comfortable in a terminal. A project is a plain folder of Markdown and TOML files, but you never have to edit them: everything changes by asking the coordinator or from the popup. You'll need Git and an agent CLI Herdr can start, such as Claude Code or oh-my-pi. macOS/Linux need Herdr 0.9.1 or newer and normally download a prebuilt binary. Native Windows x64 has been exercised with Herdr 0.9.3 and oh-my-pi 18.5.1; it currently needs PowerShell 7, Rust/Cargo 1.89+ with the MSVC toolchain, and Visual Studio C++ Build Tools. The [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md) covers installation; [Herdr notes](docs/herdr-notes.md#native-windows-port) distinguish exercised native scenarios from remaining acceptance checks.

### How do I check that Herdr Projects is running?

Run:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke doctor --plugin herdr-projects
```

The command checks the Herdr version, the tools it calls, the ticker, and each project's session. The [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md#check-your-setup) walks through a project that won't open, a thread that doesn't start, and a ticker that isn't running.

### What permissions does the coordinator need?

It runs the `herdr-projects` binary every turn, so you'll want to allow-list it in your agent **by subcommand, never the bare binary**. Allow reading and steering (`skill`, `context`, `report`, `inbox done`, `thread list`, `thread prompt`, `thread next`, `thread read`, `thread keys` and the like) and leave `thread resolve`, `sweep`, `delete`, `rename`, `routine approve` and `configure` on your agent's normal permission prompt. Leave `thread start` off the list too unless you've set `start_threads = "auto"`: then every thread start is a real confirmation. [Operations](docs/operations.md#the-allow-list-for-your-coordinator) has the exact patterns.

### Does the plugin send my project to a hosted service?

No. A project is a folder on your machine, the plugin talks to your local Herdr session, and remote threads use your own SSH machines. Your agent CLI still uses its own service as usual.

### Will it touch my branches or worktrees on its own?

Only to clean up after a thread is resolved, which happens when you resolve it, when its pull request is merged, or after `auto_resolve_days` idle. Then it removes the thread's worktree (never with force, so uncommitted changes keep it) and, only if the pull request is merged, the local branch. The thread's report and files are copied home first and always kept. It never merges or pushes itself: a merge happens when you send a thread its own "Merge the PR" line and the thread does it with its own tools.

### Where does my project live?

In `~/.herdr-projects/<name>/` by default: `PROJECT.md` for your settings and standing instructions, `AGENTS.md` for priming the coordinator, `MEMORY.md` and `memory/` for what the coordinator remembers, `TASKS.md` for the task list the coordinator keeps for you (each task assigned to you, a person, an agent profile, another machine or both: [task owners](docs/operations.md#task-owners)), `uploads/` for files you give the threads, `threads/` for thread records and reports, and `library/` for files threads produced. The safety settings live outside it, in `~/.config/herdr-projects/config.toml`, where no agent works. [Operations](docs/operations.md#where-things-live) lists every file.

### Do I have to start every thread through the coordinator?

No. Run `herdr-projects thread start` yourself, or take an agent pane you already started and make it a thread with `thread adopt`. The `herdr-projects adopt-workspace` command turns the workspace you're in into a project with its agent as the first thread.

### What if the safety settings aren't enough?

They are soft. By default the coordinator proposes threads and waits (until you turn on yolo mode in the popup), thread agents keep their normal permission prompts, which the coordinator answers for plainly in-task actions and brings to you otherwise (it may choose their model, never their launch flags), and routines may not run shell commands until you enable them and approve each command in a terminal. But agents have a shell: one that runs with skip-permission arguments can edit those files, a thread can prompt the coordinator pretending to be you, an approved routine command covers its text and not the scripts it calls, and whatever reaches memory is repeated in every later brief. [Operations](docs/operations.md#what-the-safety-settings-do-and-dont-stop) says plainly what each guard stops and what it doesn't.

### What does it cost?

Herdr Projects is free and [MIT licensed](LICENSE). Your agent CLI's usual usage charges still apply: every thread is a full agent session, and the coordinator spends tokens each turn reading its digest.
