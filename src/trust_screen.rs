//! Is an agent's pane showing a trust screen: a "trust this folder?" dialog,
//! a restricted-folder chooser, or a hooks or settings review? Such an answer
//! is saved by the harness for every later session in that folder, so text is
//! never typed into one: a brief or prompt ending in Enter would pick the
//! preselected "trust" option. Herdr does not always report these screens as
//! `blocked` (a new harness screen may read as `idle`), so the screen itself
//! is read right before any prompt is sent.
